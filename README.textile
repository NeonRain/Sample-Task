h1. Neon Rain Interactive Sample Task

If you are performing this task, then you've already taken our assessment. The assessment is a basic test of competence, while this assignment is more representative of the type of work we do. It is also intended to familiarize you with Git and Dojo. The tasks that we work on are initially described by a _story_ and a list of _requirements_. A _story_ explains the _who_, _what_, and _why_ of a task. Let's take a look at the _story_ and _requirements_ for this task.

h2. Story

As a customer, I need to be able to use a form to submit a one time payment using my credit card.

h2. Requirements

* Include Full Name, Address, City, State/Province, Country, Postal Code, Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVV2
* Country should be a selection between USA and Canada
* The State/Province select should update with the appropriate options for the selected Country. (You may use a subset of the states and provinces since this is only a sample task)
* The form must submit the payment via the Authorize.net AIM API
* The form must be submitted via Ajax and the response must be used to display either an error or a success message
* Use Dojo for javascript interaction

h2. Instructions

# First you'll want to create an account on GitHub and fork this project so you can work on it.
# Next you'll want to create an *index.php* to output an HTML page with a form that fits with the requirements above.
# Then you will need to create *payment.php* to accept the parameters from the form and submit the payment to Authorize.net using the AIM API.
# The form submission must occur using Ajax so now you need to submit the data from *index.php* to *payment.php* and get back the response.
# If the payment is declined, you will need to display the error response to the customer and allow them to try again. If it's successful, then replace the entire form with a success message.
# Make sure you commit all of the files you've created and push them up to GitHub.
# Send us the URL to your repo!

h2. Payment Processing

You will need to use Authorize.net's AIM API to submit payment. See here for details: http://developer.authorize.net/api/aim/.
